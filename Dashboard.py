    ## Aims

    After completing the course the student should be able to:
    - explain basic project management methods
    - be able to account for success factors in Health Informatics projects
    - understand basic methods and tools in the field of data science and machine learning
    - explain process models for data mining projects
    - explain the difference between rule-based methods and machine learning methods
    - apply basic project management methods
    - work in an international multidisciplinary project group
    - independently lead and implement a limited project in health informatics - document the steps in the design of a prototype for a health informatics project
    - apply the steps in a process model for data mining projects
    - apply methods from the field of text mining on different types of health informatics problems
    - explain and argue for their positions regarding the implementation of a health informatics project
    - explain how to work with sensitive health information in a safe and ethical way.

"""
The final project aims to apply data science concepts and skills on a 
medical case study that you and your team select from a public data source.
The project assumes that you bring the technical Python skills from 
previous courses (*DSHI*: Data Science for Health Informatics), as well as 
the analytical skills to argue how and why specific techniques could
enhance the problem domain related to the selected dataset.
